# image_segmentation - HDMI-IN Image Segmentation Application

## Overview

The image_segmentation application captures video input from the HDMI-IN source of the Nexcom VMC320 vehicle mount computer and performs real-time image segmentation to identify and classify objects within the captured images. This demo showcases the capability of performing object recognition and segmentation using advanced neural network techniques.

## Features

- **HDMI-IN Video Capture:** Captures video input from an HDMI source.
- **Real-time Segmentation:** Applies image segmentation algorithms to identify and classify objects in real-time.
- **Object Recognition:** Highlights and labels detected objects within the video feed.
